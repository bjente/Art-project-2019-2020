### What type of neural network should we use?
##GAN
[Here](https://towardsdatascience.com/image-generator-drawing-cartoons-with-generative-adversarial-networks-45e814ca9b6b) is a really good paper about it.
The underlying idea behind GAN is that it contains two neural networks that compete against each other in a zero-sum game framework, i.e. generator and a discriminator.
1. Generator: takes random noise as an input and generates samples as an output. Itâ€™s goal is to generate such samples that will fool the Discriminator to think that it is seeing real images while actually seeing fakes. We can think of the Generator as a counterfeit.
2. Discriminator: takes both real images from the input dataset and fake images from the Generator and outputs a verdict whether a given image is legit or not. We can think of the Discriminator as a policeman trying to catch the bad guys while letting the good guys free.

[Here](https://github.com/gsurma/image_generator/blob/master/ImageGeneratorDCGAN.ipynb) is a jupyter notebook with example cpde that we can use.
